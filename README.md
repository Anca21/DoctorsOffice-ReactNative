Hi buddy, I have a business proposal for you. I know that you are the best software developer ever(wink),
and I desperately need a new piece of software for managing my appointments.
Since I have moved to this new office, I have more patients and it's been very 
hard for me to keep track of all the appointments. Besides, as you know,
my assistant is a pretty old lady, aaaaaand she started to forgot a lot lately,
so one day I have too many patients and the other day I have none. Here is what I've been thinking:
I would like a mobile app (because I need 24/7 access to it and I don't always have my laptop) 
having two distinct plaforms(one for me and one for my patients). Starting with the doctor platform.
You know that I have trust issues and that my patients confidentiality is the most important thing, 
so I need some kind of authorization check before I have access to the application. 
After my credentials are checked, I would like to see my details and the details of my 
office(some kind of profile page). Also, a menu should be placed on the top of the screen(left or right side, wherever it fits).
The menu should have the following options: Agenda, Patients, Reminders. On the opposite side of the menu,
there should be a logo(I always wanted a logo for my office). The "agenda" option should take me to another page, 
where a calendar is filled with the patient's appointments. I should be able to add a new appointment or
access an existing one, modify it or delete it. You've seen my office, it's pretty small and crowded with 
all those patient charts, that's why, at "patients" section, I would like to have access to my patients fiels.
Oh! I almost forgot... my memory is so bad these days, that's exactly why I need "reminders" option,
which will notify me about future consulations. Finally, I would like to log out from my account(you know.. trust issues :) ).
For the patient platform, I visualize things a little bit different. A patient may login into his/her account 
using some unique credentials recieved at the first consultation. He/Her would have access to his/her own files,
but not to other patient's charts. Also, the patients should have access to my profile and to the profile of my office, 
where they will see the cosultation hours. The patients menu will contain the next option: Make an appointment,
Doctor's profile, Reminders, Medical progress. By clicking 'Make an appointment' button, the patient could access my Agenda, 
and they can reserver time for their consulation. The 'reminders' section is the same as on doctor's page... 
so that's not so complicated. Last thing, a patient should be able to check it's medical report begining with
the first consulation, and also his/her health progress. I have in mind some beautiful charts, but 
I let you decide. So, buddy, maybe it's alot to ask, but that's my dream app. Thank you in advance,
and hope you enjoy it too!
